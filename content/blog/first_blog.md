### Why Hugo?

Hugo is a flexible static site generator that has quick build times, and is easy to deploy. Hugo has an active community that posts [https://themes.gohugo.io/](themes) and templates for users to build from, including the theme used for this website. The website is deplyed using [https://www.netlify.com](Netlify) and is extremely easy and quick to maintain. The repository for my website is available [https://github.com/e-alvarado/first_site](here.)
