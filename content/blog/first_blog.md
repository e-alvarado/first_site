### Why Hugo?

Hugo is a flexible static site generator that has quick build times, and is easy to deploy. Hugo has an active community that posts *[themes]<https://themes.gohugo.io/>* and templates for users to build from, including the theme used for this website. The website is deplyed using [Netlify]<https://www.netlify.com> and with Hugo is extremely easy and quick to maintain. The repository for my website is available [here.]<https://github.com/e-alvarado/first_site>

### Why a Website?

I plan to use this website to showcase my current and previous research projects. I will include samples of my previous work under publications on the homepage, inluding my undergraduate thesis and technical paper presented with the Forestry Service. I like to apply what I've learned academically to what I enjoy personally, and as of this writing I am working on a project involving tennis data!
