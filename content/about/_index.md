Hi! I'm Edwin, a recent graduate from the University of West Florida with a MS in Data Science and previously graduated with an interdiscplinary degree from Reed College. I am passionate about communicating insights through creative data visualizations to create a narrative that is easily understood by technical and non-technical audiences alike. I believe the ability to communicate your findings is just as important as the research itself. Although I have recently completed my Master's program, I am still focused on gaining new skills and certifications through sites like Coursera and personal projects. My hobbies include playing tennis, collecting sports cards, and reading (currently reading the Scythe series.)

I enjoy doing personal projects, which you will find (added soon) in the portfolio page of this website, along with some previous research.

I am currently looking for full-time employment, remote or on-site in the Pensacola area.
